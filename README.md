MindFlex AI is an interactive, premium AI-powered tutor designed to adapt to a student's emotional and cognitive state in real-time. Built for hackathons, it showcases a fully functional glassmorphic UI, dynamic learning modules, native browser text-to-speech, and a smart dual-LLM system (Local Ollama / Groq Cloud).

## 🌟 Key Features

1. **🎭 Real-Time Emotion-Adaptive Tutoring**
   - **Focused 🟢**: Concise, professional step-by-step notes with mathematical formulas and common edge cases.
   - **Confused 🟠**: Highly supportive, encouraging tone starting with checkpoints, using real-world analogies (e.g. food recipes, box packing) rather than dense jargon.
   - **Engaged 🟣**: Active challenges presenting concrete practice problems directly in the chat interface.

2. **🤖 Heuristic Auto-Emotion Detection**
   - The tutor automatically scans the student's inputs for sentiment indicators. If the user types *"I'm stuck"* or *"practice problem"*, the tutor automatically switches state and adapts its teaching strategy.

3. **🔊 Native Browser Text-to-Speech (TTS)**
   - Click the **🔊** icon next to any tutor response to read the explanation aloud using browser-native SpeechSynthesis. No external subscription keys or servers required.

4. **⚡ Dual-LLM Backend (Hybrid Local / Cloud)**
   - **Local Ollama**: 100% offline, private inference using `qwen2.5:3b`.
   - **Groq Cloud API**: Blazing fast cloud generation using `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` (~1,000 tokens/sec).
   - Easily swap providers inside the app sidebar at runtime.

5. **📚 Interactive Lesson Modules & Concept Playgrounds**
   - Collapsible walkthrough steps powered by custom-drawn responsive CSS chevrons (supports offline/font-restricted environments cleanly).
   - Interactive calculators: Variable substitution visualizer, algebra discriminant solver, and physics kinetic energy net work calculator.

6. **📅 Adaptive Study Planner**
   - Dynamically schedules a 3-day study plan based on student quiz scores and weak areas.
   - Searchable completed topics catalog with coverage metrics and gamified overall score tracking.
